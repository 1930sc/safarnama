        <title>Every Single Sundown</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every single sundown, while I am almost my home
I see tonnes of concretes and sand, building, roads, reveries of foam
Festivities getting noiseless, Construction getting louder
Humans getting loftier, Humanity getting smaller&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving you and me wonder in hope, that someday all this will be done
All roads prepared, all buildings constructed, no dust and cement around, none
Knock, trance over, for hunger has no end, nowhere it goes, nowhere it ends
One day someone almighty is to arise, and we will see her as she mends&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no one to come, we know, right?
Only we are here, to stay persistent and use our own wisdom to solve our plight
Wisdom becoming larger, its use is becoming teenier
Hopes becoming trivial, Hopeless becoming higher&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We shall try, to curb the menace that hovers, on the wonderful future ahead
There’s a lot to be done, much has been written and said
When its seminary time in sunrise, you and I, shall gather people and dialogue
People who do this, People who do that, the book of contamination, to get an epilogue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no distant place where happiness is kept in that hidden treasure to be sought
To spend lives, struggling for that secreted pleasure.
It is all what since childhood we are taught
Big Myth, You and I know, it’s such a hell of a fatal legend and sick conspiracy, too.
Happiness is where the home is, where family is, not at some withdrawn dwelling,
It is where I am with you, you with me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I thought I must be dreaming.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I must be dreaming that
I thought I was awake,
For I was without question in
A most peculiar state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who was thinking I was dreaming
I was thinking in my sleep?
Was I awake while sleeping?
Oh, this was far too deep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or was I dreaming I was thinking
I was dreaming in the night?
And would I wake up tired or rested
Come the morning light?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarm beeped, and quickly I
Rolled off the rumpled bed,
Grateful for the clarity
That lit the day ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
