Every single sundown, while I am almost my home
I see tonnes of concretes and sand, building, roads, reveries of foam
Festivities getting noiseless, Construction getting louder
Humans getting loftier, Humanity getting smaller

Leaving you and me wonder in hope, that someday all this will be done
All roads prepared, all buildings constructed, no dust and cement around, none
Knock, trance over, for hunger has no end, nowhere it goes, nowhere it ends
One day someone almighty is to arise, and we will see her as she mends

There is no one to come, we know, right?
Only we are here, to stay persistent and use our own wisdom to solve our plight
Wisdom becoming larger, its use is becoming teenier
Hopes becoming trivial, Hopeless becoming higher

We shall try, to curb the menace that hovers, on the wonderful future ahead
There’s a lot to be done, much has been written and said
When its seminary time in sunrise, you and I, shall gather people and dialogue
People who do this, People who do that, the book of contamination, to get an epilogue

There is no distant place where happiness is kept in that hidden treasure to be sought
To spend lives, struggling for that secreted pleasure.
It is all what since childhood we are taught
Big Myth, You and I know, it’s such a hell of a fatal legend and sick conspiracy, too.
Happiness is where the home is, where family is, not at some withdrawn dwelling,
It is where I am with you, you with me.
